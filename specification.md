# Diagmarm Builder v0.0.1 - System Specification

## 1. Project Overview

Diagmarm Builder is a web-based tool that allows users to create and visualize diagrams using the mermaid.js library. Version 0.0.1 focuses on providing a simple, functional interface with two main sections: a code editor for writing mermaid syntax and a rendering area to display the resulting diagram.

### 1.1 Vision

To provide a straightforward interface for creating and visualizing mermaid diagrams, serving as the foundation for future AI-powered features.

### 1.2 Core Objectives for v0.0.1

- Create a simple, functional web interface for mermaid diagram creation
- Provide real-time rendering of mermaid diagrams
- Support all diagram types available in mermaid.js
- Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes

## 2. System Architecture for v0.0.1

For this initial version, the architecture is intentionally simple:

### 2.1 Key Components

1. **Code Editor**: A text area where users can write mermaid syntax
2. **Diagram Renderer**: A component that uses mermaid.js to render the diagram from the provided code

### 2.2 Component Interaction

```
User → Code Editor → Diagram Renderer → User
```

- User enters mermaid code in the editor
- The code is passed to the mermaid.js renderer
- The rendered diagram is displayed to the user

## 3. Folder Structure for v0.0.1

```
diagmarm-builder/
├── index.html           # Main HTML file
├── css/                 # CSS styles
│   └── styles.css       # Main stylesheet
├── js/                  # JavaScript files
│   ├── main.js          # Main application logic
│   └── mermaid-init.js  # Mermaid initialization
└── README.md            # Basic documentation
```

## 4. File Purposes for v0.0.1

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | The main HTML file that contains the structure of the application with the two-panel layout |
| `css/styles.css` | Contains all styling for the application, including the layout of the two panels |
| `js/main.js` | Contains the main application logic, including event listeners for updating the diagram when code changes |
| `js/mermaid-init.js` | Handles the initialization and configuration of mermaid.js |
| `README.md` | Basic documentation for the project |

## 5. Technology Stack for v0.0.1

### 5.1 Frontend

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the application
- **CSS3**: For styling the application
- **JavaScript**: For application logic
- **Mermaid.js**: For rendering diagrams
- **No Framework**: This version uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simplicity

### 5.2 External Dependencies

- **Mermaid.js**: Loaded via CDN for diagram rendering

## 6. User Interface Design for v0.0.1

### 6.1 Main Layout

The application will have a simple two-panel layout:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Header (Logo, Title)                                  |
+------------------------+------------------------------+
|                        |                              |
|                        |                              |
|   Code Editor Panel    |    Diagram Rendering Panel   |
|                        |                              |
|                        |                              |
|                        |                              |
+------------------------+------------------------------+
| Footer (Version, Links)                               |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

### 6.2 Key UI Components

1. **Code Editor Panel**: A text area where users can write mermaid syntax
   - Syntax highlighting is not required for v0.0.1 but could be added if time permits
   - Should have sufficient height to accommodate complex diagrams
   - May include a simple toolbar with common actions (clear, copy)

2. **Diagram Rendering Panel**: The area where the rendered diagram is displayed
   - Should update in real-time as the code is changed
   - Should display error messages if the mermaid syntax is invalid
   - Should resize the diagram appropriately to fit the panel

3. **Header**: Simple header with the application name and logo
   - Minimal design to focus on the main functionality

4. **Footer**: Simple footer with version information and any necessary links
   - Could include a link to mermaid.js documentation

### 6.3 Responsive Design

- The layout should adapt to different screen sizes
- On smaller screens, the panels may stack vertically instead of horizontally
- The application should be usable on tablets and larger mobile devices

## 7. Implementation Details for v0.0.1

### 7.1 Code Editor Implementation

1. Use a simple `<textarea>` element for the code editor
2. Set up event listeners to capture code changes
3. Implement basic features like tab support and line numbers if time permits

### 7.2 Diagram Rendering Implementation

1. Initialize mermaid.js with default configuration
2. Create a target div for the rendered diagram
3. Update the rendered diagram whenever the code changes
4. Implement error handling to display meaningful error messages

### 7.3 Error Handling

1. Catch and display mermaid syntax errors
2. Provide clear error messages to help users correct their code
3. Ensure the application doesn't crash when errors occur

## 8. Development Approach for v0.0.1

### 8.1 Development Steps

1. Set up the basic HTML structure with the two-panel layout
2. Add CSS styling to create a clean, functional interface
3. Integrate mermaid.js via CDN
4. Implement the code editor functionality
5. Set up the diagram rendering with real-time updates
6. Add basic error handling
7. Test across different browsers and screen sizes
8. Optimize performance and fix any issues

### 8.2 Testing

- Manual testing across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Testing on different screen sizes to ensure responsive design
- Validation of mermaid syntax handling and error reporting

## 9. Future Enhancements (Post v0.0.1)

While not part of v0.0.1, the following features are planned for future versions:

1. AI-powered diagram generation from natural language prompts
2. Saving and loading diagrams
3. Exporting diagrams in various formats
4. Enhanced code editor with syntax highlighting
5. User accounts and cloud storage
6. Collaborative editing features

## 10. Conclusion

Diagmarm Builder v0.0.1 provides a simple but functional foundation for creating and visualizing mermaid diagrams. By focusing on the core functionality of code editing and diagram rendering, this version establishes the basic structure that will be expanded upon in future releases.
